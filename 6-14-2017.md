# Javascript and Group Theory

Javascript was invented in 1995 by Brandon Eich, in order to automate HTML presentations in Netscape Navigator. Since then, Javascript interpreters have been built into virtually every internet browser. The language has been standardized by a committee, and receives enhancements and improvements to this day.

One of the interesting aspects of the Javascript programming language is a data-structure known of colloquially as a **dictionary**. We'll look closely at the dictionary, and then use it to investigate a topic in Mathematics, called a **permutation group**.

## Getting Started

### Opening The Command Line

A Javascript **command line** is a text interface for giving commands to a Javascript interpreter. The interpreter reads the command, evaluates the order, prints its results, and then readies itself for a new line. You can use the command line to quickly test small bits of code for correctness.

To open the Javascript command line in Chrome, go to **View -> Developer -> Javascript Console**. You will be presented with a blank page and a blinking cursor. The page will hold your old commands as you type them.

### Warming Up

Let's try a few commands. Try entering the number `17` on the command line, and then hit enter. The result should look like.

```
> 17
< 17
```

The right caret means that `17` went in and the left caret below means that `17` came out. Let's enter a decimal, like `10.23`

```
> 10.23
< 10.23
```

We see that Javascript reflects numbers back at us.

Let's type a word...

```
> zardoz
< Uncaught ReferenceError: zardoz is not defined
```

Javascript has given us an error. The error has to do with references and defining the word zardoz.

### Definitions

To explain better the error we have received, I will explain how to define a reference. In this case, the reference we want to define is the word zardoz. It does not matter what we define it to be, so I will use the number 77. To define zardoz as a reference to the number 77, I type

```
> zardoz = 77
< 77
```

Now, if I type `zardoz`, I get:

```
> zardoz
< 77
```

and there is no error! We see that words can be defined, and that our error meant we had not defined the word we intended to use.


## Dictionaries
